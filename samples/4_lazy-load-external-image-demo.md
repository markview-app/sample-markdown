# Lazy Loading External Images Demo

> MarkView's lazy loading feature for external images ensures that images are only loaded when they are about to enter the viewport, improving page load performance and user experience.

## Expected Behavior

- Images should NOT load immediately when the page opens
- Images should load ONLY when you scroll them into view
- You should see a smooth fade-in animation (0.3s)
- Network tab should show images loading progressively as you scroll
